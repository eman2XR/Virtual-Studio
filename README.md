# Virtual-Studio
![Virtual Studio banner image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsilicoStudios/Virtual-Studio/master/Assets/Virtual%20Studio/Icons/build/VirtualStudio-bannerfallbackcropped1.PNG)<br>
A collection of VR painting and design tools developed for the Unity game engine. We brought all the features and functionality of Tilt Brush to Unity. Use it to create 3D art for your games, create your own VR painting applications, or add design functionality to existing VR apps.

Build using C# a mesh extraction algortim and VRTK :https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK . Note that VRTK is not required for Virtual Studio to work, but without it some functionality will be lost. This repository includes a stripped down version of VRKT and SteamVR.
